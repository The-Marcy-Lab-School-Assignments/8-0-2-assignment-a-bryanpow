# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
the danger with making api requests with api keys from the front end is that it will be exposed on the client even if you try to hide it in a env file. Doing it on the server fixes this by handling the fetch before it gets to the client.
